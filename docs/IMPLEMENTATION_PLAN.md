# KubeWatch TUI Golang Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

**Project Approach**: Contract-first development with 3 specialized development roles building a Kubernetes monitoring TUI in Go using the Charm Bubble Tea framework.

**Team Structure**: 
- Backend/K8s Agent: Kubernetes client integration and operations
- Frontend/TUI Agent: Bubble Tea UI implementation and user interactions  
- Infrastructure/Platform Agent: Build system, testing, and deployment

**Critical Dependencies**:
- Bubble Tea framework maturity for complex TUI requirements
- Kubernetes client-go watch stream performance
- Terminal compatibility across platforms

**Success Criteria**:
- Replace `watch kubectl` workflows with <2s startup
- Real-time updates without polling
- Single binary <15MB
- Memory usage <50MB for 500+ resources

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Architecture Pattern
**Structure**: Modular monolith with clear boundaries
**Communication**: Event-driven internal, Watch streams for K8s
**Data Strategy**: In-memory state with bounded caches
**Deployment**: Single static binary per platform

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Contract Definition**: Go interfaces with mock generation
   ```go
   //go:generate mockgen -source=client.go -destination=mocks/client_mock.go
   type KubernetesClient interface {
       ListPods(ctx context.Context, namespace string) ([]*v1.Pod, error)
       WatchPods(ctx context.Context, namespace string) (<-chan watch.Event, error)
       DeletePod(ctx context.Context, namespace, name string) error
       StreamLogs(ctx context.Context, namespace, pod string) (io.ReadCloser, error)
   }
   ```

2. **State Management**: Centralized state with mutex protection
   ```go
   type AppState struct {
       mu sync.RWMutex
       resources map[string][]runtime.Object
       selected  map[string]bool
   }
   ```

3. **Event System**: Channel-based communication
   ```go
   type Event struct {
       Type EventType
       Data interface{}
   }
   type EventBus struct {
       events chan Event
       subscribers map[EventType][]chan Event
   }
   ```

4. **Error Handling**: Wrapped errors with context
   ```go
   return fmt.Errorf("failed to list pods in namespace %s: %w", namespace, err)
   ```

5. **Testing Strategy**: Table-driven tests with mocks

### Technology Stack
```yaml
Language: Go 1.21+
TUI Framework: Bubble Tea (github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
K8s Client: client-go (k8s.io/client-go)
Styling: Lipgloss (github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss)
Components: Bubbles (github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles)
Testing: testify + mockgen
Build: Make + goreleaser
```

## 3. Development Workflow

### Local Development Setup
```bash
1. git clone <repository>
2. cd kubewatch-tui/golang-implementation
3. make deps        # Install dependencies
4. make generate    # Generate mocks
5. make build       # Build binary
6. ./bin/kubewatch  # Run application
```

### Development Conventions
- **API Design**: RESTful patterns for K8s operations
- **Naming**: Standard Go conventions (mixedCaps)
- **Errors**: Always wrap with context
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% coverage
- **Git Flow**: Feature branches → main

### Deployment Process
1. PR with passing tests
2. Automated build validation
3. Manual review required
4. Merge triggers release build
5. GitHub releases with binaries

## 6. Agent Coordination Protocol

### Message-Based Checkpoints
```go
type AgentStatus struct {
    AgentID    string
    Status     string // "ready", "blocked", "in_progress"
    Artifact   string // path to deliverable
    Blockers   []string
    Confidence float64
}

// Example usage:
status := AgentStatus{
    AgentID:    "backend_k8s",
    Status:     "blocked",
    Artifact:   "internal/k8s/logs.go",
    Blockers:   []string{"need log streaming interface review"},
    Confidence: 0.7,
}
```

### Integration Points
```yaml
continuous_integration:
  - trigger: "interface change"
    action: "regenerate mocks"
    notify: "all agents"
  
  - trigger: "new event type"
    action: "update event handlers"
    notify: "consuming agents"

scheduled_integration:
  daily_standup:
    time: "10:00 UTC"
    format: "status update via PR comment"
    timeout: "30 minutes"
  
  weekly_integration:
    time: "Friday 14:00 UTC"
    action: "full integration test"
    participants: "all agents"
```

### Conflict Resolution
```yaml
git_conflicts:
  strategy: "feature branches"
  merge: "rebase on main"
  conflict: "owning agent resolves"

interface_conflicts:
  detection: "compile failure"
  resolution: "proposing agent updates"
  review: "affected agents approve"

performance_regression:
  detection: "benchmark failure"
  resolution: "revert and fix"
  prevention: "pre-merge benchmarks"
```

## 7. Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Bubble Tea performance with large tables
- **Mitigation**: Early spike with 1000+ items
- **Fallback**: Implement custom viewport renderer
- **Owner**: Frontend agent
- **Decision by**: End of Stage 1

**Risk**: K8s watch stream reliability
- **Mitigation**: Implement exponential backoff
- **Fallback**: Polling with smart intervals
- **Owner**: Backend agent
- **Decision by**: During Stage 2

**Risk**: Binary size exceeds 15MB
- **Mitigation**: Progressive linking optimization
- **Fallback**: Separate builds per platform
- **Owner**: Infrastructure agent
- **Decision by**: Stage 3

### Integration Risks

**Risk**: Event system becomes bottleneck
- **Mitigation**: Buffered channels with monitoring
- **Fallback**: Direct function calls
- **Owner**: Infrastructure agent
- **Monitor**: Continuous performance tests

**Risk**: State synchronization issues
- **Mitigation**: Single source of truth pattern
- **Fallback**: Simplified state model
- **Owner**: All agents
- **Review**: Each integration checkpoint

## 8. Communication Plan

### Async Updates
```yaml
format: "GitHub issue comments"
frequency: "On significant progress"
template: |
  ## Status Update - [Agent Name]
  
  **Completed**:
  - [ ] Task 1
  - [x] Task 2
  
  **Blocked by**:
  - Need review of interface X
  
  **Next 24h**:
  - Implement feature Y
  
  **Confidence**: 85%
```

### Sync Points
```yaml
continuous_check:
  format: "GitHub Actions status"
  trigger: "on every commit"
  timeout: "5 minutes"
  
stage_integration:
  format: "Integration test suite"
  trigger: "stage completion"
  validation:
    - All features integrated
    - Performance benchmarks pass
    - No blocking issues
```

## 10. Agent Creation Requirements

**IMPORTANT: The following agents need to be created in Claude Code:**

### 1. Backend/K8s Agent
```yaml
name: "kubewatch-backend"
context: |
  You are developing the Kubernetes integration layer for KubeWatch TUI.
  Technology: Go, client-go, informers
  Focus: Efficient K8s API usage, watch streams, caching
provide:
  - This implementation plan
  - Original product spec
  - Your role section from this doc
  - Access to golang-implementation/ directory
```

### 2. Frontend/TUI Agent  
```yaml
name: "kubewatch-frontend"
context: |
  You are developing the terminal UI for KubeWatch TUI.
  Technology: Go, Bubble Tea, Lipgloss, Bubbles
  Focus: Responsive TUI, real-time updates, keyboard UX
provide:
  - This implementation plan
  - Original product spec
  - Your role section from this doc
  - Access to golang-implementation/ directory
```

### 3. Infrastructure/Platform Agent
```yaml
name: "kubewatch-platform"
context: |
  You are setting up build/test/deploy for KubeWatch TUI.
  Technology: Make, GitHub Actions, goreleaser
  Focus: CI/CD, testing, cross-platform builds
provide:
  - This implementation plan
  - Original product spec  
  - Your role section from this doc
  - Access to golang-implementation/ directory
```

Each agent should begin by:
1. Creating their owned directories
2. Implementing Stage 0 deliverables
3. Setting up their development environment
4. Creating initial tests/mocks

## Success Definition

This plan succeeds when:
- ✓ 3 agents can work independently for extended periods
- ✓ <20% time spent coordinating
- ✓ Integration issues caught at stage boundaries
- ✓ Each stage produces working software
- ✓ Clear escalation path exists
- ✓ No agent blocked for more than one integration cycle

The plan prioritizes developer autonomy while ensuring successful integration through well-defined contracts and stage-based checkpoints.
