# Kubewatch Template-Driven Architecture - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan transforms Kubewatch from hardcoded resource handling to a fully template-driven, configuration-based architecture. The plan enables 4+ developers to work in parallel with minimal coordination, delivering a production-ready system that supports custom Kubernetes resources (CRDs) in 4 weeks.

## Technical Architecture

### Architecture Pattern: Plugin-Based Resource System
- **Structure**: Modular resource handlers driven by YAML configurations
- **Communication**: Template engine for all formatting and display logic
- **Data Strategy**: Unstructured dynamic client for universal resource access
- **Deployment**: Single binary with embedded defaults, runtime overrides

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Contract Definition**: YAML-based resource configurations with JSON schema validation
2. **State Management**: Generic state container using unstructured.Unstructured
3. **Authentication**: Reuse existing kubeconfig handling
4. **Error Handling**: Template fallbacks with error indicators
5. **Testing Strategy**: Config-driven tests with mock resources

## Development Workflow

### Local Development Setup
```bash
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: go mod download
3. Build: make build
4. Test: make test
5. Run: ./kubewatch
```

### Deployment Process
1. Code review with automated config validation
2. Merge triggers CI/CD pipeline
3. Binary built with embedded configs
4. Release with backward compatibility

### Development Conventions
- YAML configs follow Kubernetes conventions
- Templates use Go template syntax
- All resources must have embedded defaults
- User overrides in ~/.config/kubewatch/

## Team Responsibilities

### Backend/Config Agent
**Owns:**
✓ Resource configuration schema (internal/config/schema/)
✓ Configuration loading and validation (internal/config/loader/)
✓ Resource registry implementation (internal/config/registry/)
✓ Template engine K8s extensions (internal/template/k8s/)

**Delivers by Stage:**
- Stage 0: Schema definitions, validation logic
- Stage 1: Registry with embedded config loading
- Stage 2: Override system with hot reload
- Stage 3: CRD auto-discovery

**Dependencies:**
- Needs: None (can start immediately)
- Provides: Config schema for all other agents

**Success Metrics:**
- Schema validates all resource configs
- Registry loads configs in <100ms
- Override system with file watching
- 100% backward compatibility

### Frontend/UI Agent
**Owns:**
✓ Generic resource view (internal/ui/views/generic_resource_view.go)
✓ Dynamic column generation (internal/ui/views/columns/)
✓ Template-based formatting integration
✓ Operation execution framework

**Delivers by Stage:**
- Stage 0: Generic view interface design
- Stage 1: Replace hardcoded views with generic handler
- Stage 2: Dynamic column management
- Stage 3: Config editor UI

**Dependencies:**
- Needs: Config schema (Stage 0)
- Needs: At least one resource config (Stage 1)
- Provides: Generic UI for all resources

**Success Metrics:**
- All 7 existing resources working
- <10ms render time per resource
- Zero visual regression
- Config-driven column layout

### Resource/Template Agent
**Owns:**
✓ Resource YAML configurations (configs/resources/embedded/)
✓ Template formatters (configs/templates/formatters/)
✓ Operation definitions for each resource
✓ Default template library

**Delivers by Stage:**
- Stage 0: Pod and Deployment configs
- Stage 1: All core resource configs
- Stage 2: Template formatter library
- Stage 3: CRD examples and docs

**Dependencies:**
- Needs: Config schema (Stage 0)
- Provides: Resource definitions for UI

**Success Metrics:**
- All 7 resources converted to YAML
- Templates match current formatting
- Operations properly defined
- Documentation for each config

### Platform/Integration Agent
**Owns:**
✓ Build system modifications (Makefile, embed directives)
✓ Dynamic Kubernetes client (internal/k8s/dynamic/)
✓ Testing infrastructure updates
✓ CI/CD pipeline changes

**Delivers by Stage:**
- Stage 0: Embed system for configs
- Stage 1: Dynamic client implementation
- Stage 2: Config validation in CI
- Stage 3: Release automation

**Dependencies:**
- Needs: Config structure (Stage 0)
- Provides: Build and runtime infrastructure

**Success Metrics:**
- Configs embedded in binary
- Dynamic client handles all resources
- CI validates all configs
- Zero-downtime migration

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Implementation
- Keep existing code untouched
- Build new system alongside
- Feature flag for switching

### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout
- Enable for one resource type
- Gather feedback and metrics
- Fix issues before proceeding

### Phase 3: Full Migration
- Switch all resources to new system
- Remove old hardcoded logic
- Update documentation

### Phase 4: Deprecation
- Mark old code as deprecated
- Provide migration tools
- Remove in next major version

## Conclusion

This implementation plan enables true parallel development with clear ownership boundaries and minimal coordination overhead. Each agent can work independently for 80% of their tasks, with well-defined integration points for the remaining 20%. The staged approach ensures continuous progress visibility and early issue detection.

**Key Success Factors:**
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Minimal shared code
- Contract-first development
- Continuous integration
- Regular sync points

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 4-week delivery timeline
- 80% code reduction
- 100% backward compatibility
- Support for any K8s resource
- Maintainable and extensible architecture
